# Super Store Sales analysis
The provided code snippet involves data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Here is a description of the code:

1. Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the code, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and warnings.

2. Reading Data: The code reads data from a JSON file called 'super_store_data.json' into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Data Preprocessing: The 'Order Date' and 'Ship Date' columns are converted to datetime format using the `pd.to_datetime()` function. Additionally, new columns 'Year' and 'Month' are created from the 'Order Date' column to extract the year and month information respectively.

4. Function Definition: The code defines a function called `convert_to_millions()` that converts a given number to a string representation in millions, with two decimal places. Similarly, the `convert_to_thousands()` function converts a number to a string representation in thousands, without decimal places.

5. Total Sales and Total Profit: The code calculates the total sales and total profit by summing the 'Sales' and 'Profit' columns of the DataFrame respectively. These values are formatted using the respective conversion functions and displayed with horizontal lines.

6. Sales Visualization: Several visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze sales data:
   - Line Plot: A line plot is created to show the trend of sales over time for the year 2020.
   - Bar Plot: Bar plots are generated to show the sum of sales by year and region, sales by month and year, and the sum of sales by months.
   - Pie Chart: Pie charts are used to display the proportion of sales by region and the proportion of profit by region. The charts are labeled with region names and percentage values.

Each visualization provides insights into the sales trends, regional distribution, and overall performance of the super store.

It's important to note that the code assumes the availability of the 'super_store_data.json' file and its compatibility with the provided code.
