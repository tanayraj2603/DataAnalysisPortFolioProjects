# IT_Spend Reports

I got data from Kaggle.

- These datasets have four different aspects of the IT company:

  - Actual cost, Budget cost, forecast cost, and Cost Sources/Elements.

- The end goal was to create a dashboard that gives information on how their business is going on in the context of Profit, Regions, and Const distribution.

- Tool: Power BI

* Three Reports:

  - Headline: Comparison between Actual cost, Budget cost, and Forecast cost Over time and Regions.

  - Regions: Cost Elements and sources in the context of Regions.

  - Decomposition: Decomposition of whole dataset.
