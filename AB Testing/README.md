# A/B Testing

In A/B testing, I analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. 

Two campaigns were performed by the company:

    1. Control Campaign
    2. Test Campaign

Goal of this A/B testing is which marketing strategy to choose according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns so it helps to boost sales, followers, or traffic on website. 



## Features

- The number of website clicks from both campaigns
- The amount of content viewed after reaching the website from both campaigns
- The number of products added to the cart from both campaigns

- The relationship between the number of products added to the cart and the number of sales from both campaigns
